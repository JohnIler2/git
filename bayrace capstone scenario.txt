scenarios:
1. gets in boat at marina and heads out to local bay to hunt alligators for making alligator jerky. 
2. Need to find the following items: Rifle, Turbo Prop, Moon Shine, and Lucky Hat along the way. 
3. while hunting for alligator, encounters an alligator and needs a rifle for a successful hunt. Without rifle no alligator - heads back to dock. 
4. While out hunting for alligator a local bayou racer named "Swamp Racer" appears and wants to race for "Bayou Classic" bragging rights. In order to win the race you must have the "Turbo Prop", Moon Shine, and Lucky Hat. If you do not have all three items you will lose. If you lose you head back to dock. If you win you still head back to dock or continue alligator hunting. 



Tiles needed for events are as follows:
1. starting at dock and heading out to the bay. Need to check if rifle and lucky hat is on board. You look around and find the rifle and lucky hat. Both items will always be there. 
2. Tile that instantly gives you Turbo Prop. You find it floating near the shoreline. 
3. Tile that instantly gives you Moon Shine. You find it tied to a trot line
4. event: Tile in which user encounters alligator and attempts to shoot it. User will always be able to kill the alligator because rifle will always be on-board the boat. 
5. event: Tile in which Swamp Racer appears and wants to race. You can race at all times, but will not win if you have not previously discovered the tiles revealing the turbo prop and moon shine.
